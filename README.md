# Composition-Driven Discovery and Screening of High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts

The `RF_single.py` script in this directory provides a simple example for predicting high-entropy alloy (HEA) properties at equimolar compositions using a Random Forest regression model.

- **Input:** Precomputed elemental-composition features and target properties (e.g., synthesizability metrics or cosine similarity to Pt) for equimolar HEAs.
- **Feature Engineering:** Automated extraction and aggregation of elemental descriptors (atomic mass, electronegativity, radius, etc.).
- **Model:** Random Forest regressor with fixed hyperparameters (no hyperparameter optimization included).
- **Output:** Cross-validation performance metrics, trained model artifacts, and prediction results.

This script is intended as a minimal working reference and starting point for composition-driven machine learning workflows in HEA discovery.
